# What is API

Before we get into REST we shortly take a look at what an API actually is:

- API stands for Application Programming Interface.
- It's like a messenger that allows two different software systems to communicate with each other.
- It defines the rules and protocols that enable this communication.
- APIs can be used to access data, functionality, or services from other software applications or platforms.
- They allow developers to build upon existing functionality without having to recreate it from scratch.
- APIs can be public, allowing access to anyone, or private, restricted to specific users or applications.
- Examples of APIs include those provided by social media platforms for developers to integrate their apps with, or those used by payment gateways for processing transactions.
- APIs are crucial for enabling interoperability and integration between different software systems and services.

**To better understand the functionality and purpose of an API, lets look at a real-life example:**

Imagine visiting a new restaurant. You're there to order food, and since you haven't been there before, you don't exactly know what type of food they serve.

The server then approaches you with a menu so you can pick what you'd like to eat. After making your choice, the server then goes to the kitchen and gets your food.

In this case, the server is the API who is connecting you to the kitchen. The API's documentation is the menu. The request is made when you pick what you'd like to eat, and the response is the food being served.
